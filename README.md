# tSDRG_PBC
Tree tensor network (TTN) strong disorder renormalisation (SDRG) with periodic boundary conditions (PBC).

This code was used as a comparison to disordered MERA in the paper "Entanglement renormalization for disordered systems" by Andrew M. Goldsborough and Glen Evenbly. https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07652.

It is a PBC version of the algorithm developed for the paper "Self-assembling tensor networks and holography in disordered spin chains" by Andrew M. Goldsborough and Rudolf A. RÃ¶mer, Phys. Rev. B 89, 214203. https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.89.214203. 

If this code is used in full or part to produce further scientific publications please cite our original paper.

The code uses the "ncon" function by R. N. C. Pfeifer, G. Evenbly, S. Singh, G. Vidal, arXiv:1402.0939. http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0939. The code can be downloaded by selecting "other formats" and "download source" on arXiv.
